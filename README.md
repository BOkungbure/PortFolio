#### This is a repository of personal SQL analysis I conduct for data exploration on opensource data sets
1. The file "Data_Exploration_SQL_GlobalCovidData.sql" is a data exploration experiment on infections and deaths resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
   It includes queries for calculating the ratio of infections to populations & deaths to populations.

2. The "SQL_Sales_Database" contains exploration of sales data with an open source data base
